# Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop robust machine learning models to accurately predict crop yields based on various environmental and agricultural factors. By leveraging historical data on crop yields, temperature, rainfall, pesticide usage, and other relevant variables, the project seeks to provide valuable insights for farmers, agricultural researchers, and policymakers.
Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
Data/: Contains the raw data files used for training and testing the models.
Notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project.


# Models
The following machine-learning models are explored in this project:
XGBoost
Random Forest
Evaluation Metrics

# The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared (R2) score

# Collaboration and Contributions
This project is open to collaboration and contributions from individuals interested in machine learning, agriculture, and data science. We welcome suggestions, bug reports, and pull requests to further improve the project.
